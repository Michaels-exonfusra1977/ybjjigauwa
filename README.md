OMG, just finished watching Lilo & Stitch and I'm telling you, that movie hits different after a long day. Like, Stitch is the ultimate chaotic good character, you know what I mean? One minute he's like this pure ball of destruction, and the next, he's all ohana means family. Seriously, broke my heart a little.

You ever just melt watching those moments between Lilo and her sister? Reminds me of me and my sis when we were little, always up to trouble. But could they make a cuter alien? I mean, come on Disney. ðŸ˜‚ All those scenes with him causing havoc are low-key giving me life. Maybe I should download the movie... you know, as a pick-me-up for bad days. LOL.

> Can't decide if I'm more in awe of Lilo's sass or Stitch's ridiculousness. Probably a tie. ðŸ˜‚ Like, how is a little girl so iconic?! The way she roasted that brat at hula class was everything. Lessons to live by, not gonna lie. ðŸ–¤

Oh, and the soundtrack! Like, forgot how much of a mood all those Elvis songs are. You totally get why even a rogue alien critter can't resist it. ðŸ•º Anyway, I might just have to watch the movie again and invite everyone for a movie night. Because... why not, right?

Random thoughtâ€”what if we all had a Stitch in our lives randomly wrecking stuff but also being our ride or die? Kinda need that kind of drama right now, just enough chaos to keep things interesting without full-on apocalypse. ðŸ˜‚

For no reason at all: let var isAlienCute = true; ðŸ˜‚ Don't ask why that code bit, just popped into my head! It's late, and logic is out the window apparently.

Okay, I'm about to crash. Stitch-level chaos done exhausted me. ðŸ˜‚ Catch you later!
